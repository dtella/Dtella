== DTELLA README ==
(The basic important stuff!)

= Welcome =

If you run into any roadblocks, you can go to http://dtella.org and
click [IRC] to chat with all the Dtella users from your browser.

= Step 1: Get a Client =

When you start Dtella, it just runs invisibly in the background.
In order to accomplish anything useful, you'll have to connect to it
with a DC client. Listed below are the most common clients for each
supported operating system:

Windows:
DC++           http://www.dcpp.net/

OS X:
Shakespeer     http://shakespeer.bzero.se/

Linux:
LinuxDC++       http://linuxdcpp.berlios.de


= Step 2: Connection Information =

Create a favorite hub in DC++ with these options:
-> Name:    Dtella
-> Address: 127.0.0.1:7314


= Step 3: Port Forwards & Firewalls =

Dtella needs a UDP port for peer communication, and DC++ needs
a TCP port for file transfers.  If you have a firewall or router
that's blocking ports, then check out these guides:

http://wiki.dtella.org/wiki/Router_Setup_Guide


= Step 4: Share =

Once you're on, you'll have to share some files unless you just
want to chat.  In DC++, go here to get started:

File > Settings > Sharing


= Getting Help within Dtella =

Type !help into the main chat to see a list of Dtella commands.
