Dtella runs invisibly in the background.  You have to connect to
it using a DC client.  The most common one is DC++:

Create a favorite hub, with an address of 127.0.0.1:7314

Dtella needs a UDP port for peer communication, and DC++
needs a TCP port for file transfers.  If you have a firewall or
router, then check out these guides:

Once you're on, you'll have to share some files unless you just
want to chat.  In DC++, go to:

File > Settings > Sharing

Type !help into the main chat to see a list of Dtella commands.
